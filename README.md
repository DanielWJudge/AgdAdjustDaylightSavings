## Installation

1. Download the latest installation zip file from the [list of releases](https://github.com/DanielWJudge/AgdAdjustDaylightSavings/releases/).
2. Extract .zip file to a directory

## Special Note

1. Make a backup copy of any files you are adjusting. This will help ensure you always have the original data.
2. This program adjusts ALL files that have data after the time change. Even those that were initialized after the time change and don't need adjusting. The program is unable to determine when a device was initialized. It only knows when the data starts and ends.
